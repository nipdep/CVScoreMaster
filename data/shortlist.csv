WORK EXPERIENCE
Intervest Software Technologies
Intern Software Engineer | January 2022 - July 2022
Completed 6-month internship by contributing to two of their
main insurance products namely the WAPP, and PetSure.
Worked on many R&D tasks and was involved with developing an
automation framework for the team.
Part-time Software Engineer | July 2022 - December 2022
Made contributions to their two main insurance products namely
the WAPP, and PetSure. Worked mainly on R&D issues regarding
AWS Cloud Services, GPay and CSP enforcing.
PROJECTS
RAAS - Revenue and Arrears Assesment (Ongoing)
RAAS is a web application built to digitize data of projects
managed by Sri Lankan local government bodies. The entered
data should also be viewable by provincial or national-level users
of the system. All provincial and national level users should be
able to visualize status of overall project using the applications
visualization features. The application should also provide the
capability to run surveys local-government level.
Technologies: ReactJS, SpringBoot, MySQL
Afooh - Project Management Tool
A project management tool specialized in catering to the needs of
the IT industry, and customizable to the client's needs. This tool
integrates various other tools and functionalities that are found
within different solutions. The application will provide functionality
for the teams to chat, which includes document sharing. Contains
various features that could increase the productivity of a project
manager by providing various visualizing and reporting tools
available to them. The application also provides test case and test
suite management features with release management
Technologies: ReactJS, AWS AppSync, AWS APIGateway, AWS
Aurora MySQL, AWS Cognito, AWS Lambda, NodeJS
JustBuild App - (Level 2 Software Project)
Web application that is built upon Amazon's Webservices to help
construction companies manage their projects and resources, and
employees to track the progress of their corresponding tasks in an
efficient and reliable manner. The product also contains a mobile
application built using React Native that is a stripped down
version of the web application.
Technologies: ReactJS, AWS, GraphQL, DynamoDB, React Native
OCF (E-Commerce application)
A simple shopping platform for small-scale businesses who want
to make an online presence. The idea here is that each store
owner who registers with the system will get their own mobile
app and a shared web app to manage the store reducing the
normal development and deployment times of a full-scale
platform.
Technologies: React, Flutter, AWS (CDK,
Cognito, S3, DynamoDB), Magento, NodeJS
Lambda,
Appsync,
Final Year Research Project (Ongoing)
This project aims to develop a system that could be used to detect
fake news by assigning credit scores to social media posts. Fake
news has been plaguing social media in recent years. We will
analyze user accounts based on the information provided by the
social network's publically available APIs and use that information
and the shared post's information to assign scores of credibility to
a certain post found on social media, helping flag malicious posts.
Technologies: NLP, NLTK, Python, ML
